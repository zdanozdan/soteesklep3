After registration in your mBank account, your bussiness partners who have accounts in mBank can pay in an easy way, what is more, on-line. Check how you can use mTRANSFER in your business. mTransfer makes ordering bank transfers much easier - you do not have to introduce your addressee's data and account number. In most cases also the sum and transfer date are already filled in by a salesperson. 
mTRANSFER is as safe as other free transfers in mBank - you confirm it by means of one-time password from the active password list.
The executed mTRANSFER transfer is marked as such in the account record, the ordered transfer (future date) is marked as planned operation and can be cancelled. 
Attention! If you want to use mTRANSFER service you need an active list of one-time passwords.";
